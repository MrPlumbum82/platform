# Contributing Guidlines

## Repositories
 * `platform` - guidelines, documentation and specifications only
* `platform-api` - web json api project
* `platform-web-ui` - public facing website project
* `platf0rm-android` - mobile project (android)

## Contributing
1. git clone the repo for the project
2. create a feature branch for the changes you are going to make
3. once done, push changes to remote branch
4. create a pull request before merging to master
5. start discussion and let the majority decide if PR is good to merge

*note:* item#5 can be skipped altogether if your changes are too small and you are confident enough with your changes (but please don't break the app)

## Branching
1. A feature branch (`feature/{feature-name}`) based on `master` shall be created for a feature you'll be working on
2. The branch should only be worked on by a single developer
3. For cases where you need to commit changes on an **un-merged** `feature branch`, you should create a new branch based on that `feature branch` and a pull-request should follow

## Feature suggestion
Project-specific issues should be created under a specific project. Otherwise, it can be created on the `platform` main repo
